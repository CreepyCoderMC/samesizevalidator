# Same Size Validator
This module is small but easy to use. The purpose of this module is to check if the target string is length equals the source string length. It can compare strings and arrays.
## Validation processes
The code checks that the source value is same length than the target.
### Compare method
This method compare both source value and target value length to see if they are equal.
## Code sample
This following code is actually how I tested that all methods correctly functioned as intended, is also provided in this module.
```
import { valueIsSameSize } from '@teamcoder/samesizevalidator';

console.log( "Testing Condition  1 Passed = " + !valueIsSameSize( "Hallo " , "world" ) );
console.log( "Testing Condition  2 Passed = " + valueIsSameSize(  "Hallo " , "world" ) );
```
The results will look as follows
```
Testing Condition  1 Passed = true
Testing Condition  2 Passed = true
```
## Function Parameters
### Parameters Passed
```
@param  { String , Array } source        The source value to be checked
@param  { String , Array } target        The target value to be checked
```
### Parameters Returned
```
@return { Boolean        }               Validation passed or failed
```
